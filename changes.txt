Updates in v0.6.5
SETUP:
1. Added requirement for tslearn for the clustering module mainly.

CLUSTERING:
1. Added new module.


NOISE:
1. Optimized merge_chunks() to use less time getting the time range.

==================================================================
Updates in v0.6.4
TYPES:
1. Check lower case only for method in CorrData.stack()
2. Bugs and improvements in DvvData and CorrData to save large attribute to asdf
3. Added psd() method in CorrData to plot psd of the CorrData result.
4. Added plot() method in FFTData to plot the amplitude spectrum of the FFT results.
5. Improved plot() for DvvData with smoothing option.
6. Minor bug fixes and improvement for FFTData in merging and plotting.

DOWNLOADERS:
1. Use inventory to remove response in read_data for miniseed
2. Added ms2asdf() to convert miniseed files to asdf files.

NOISE:
1. Optimize memory usage for merge_chunks()

PLOTTING:
1. Added plot_psd() to plot the psd of an array (works with 1-d and 2-d array only for now.)
2. Updated plot_eventsequence() to have the option of plotting depth as the ydata.

UTILS:
1. Minor bug fixes in read_gmtlines()
2. Added psd() to get the power spectral density of an array

==================================================================
Updates in v0.6.3.1
1. Fixed the size issue when saving "time" to ASDF file. HDF file limits the attribute
  size to 64k or less. We split time to time_mean and np.float32(time) to reduce the size.
  This is a temporary fix. Hopefully HDF could lift the size limit for attributes.

==================================================================
Updates in v0.6.3
NOISE
1. Removed ncomp in do_correlation(). Setup a warning message if old usage is used.
2. Change defaults for acorr_only and xcorr_only both to False in do_correlation().
3. Added option to stack in merging(). This option could replace do_stacking() if no
  rotation. Renamed merging() to merge_pairs(). The old name is kept for compatibility.
4. Updated extract_corrdata() to read "side" attribute if available.
5. Added merge_chunks() to merge correlation files, to reduce the number of files, with
  the option for stacking.


DOWNLOADERS
1. Return inventory in get_event_waveforms()
2. Drop duplicates in get_sta_list() and fixed minor bug when channels might be skipped.
3. Change default region to globe in get_events()

UTILS
1. Added mag_duration(), modified from obspyDMT.utils.event_handler.py
2. Renamed qml_to_event_list() to qml2list(). Added option to convert to pandas dataframe.
3. Fixed a bug in slicing_trace(), where the index was float instead of integer.
4. Added get_filelist() and slice_list().
5. Fixed a bug in sclicing_trace() when returning zeros array with errors. changed to return
    empty arrays.

PLOTTING
1. Added plot_eventsequence() to plot event with time.

TYPES
1. Added "side" attribute in CorrData() to mark whether the corrdata is two-sided or one-side only.
2. Revised CorrData.plot() to check "side" attribute when plotting.
3. Added copy() method in CorrData class to allow the user to copy the object, to avoid directly
  modifying the object values.
4. Added split() method in CorrData class to split the negative and positive sides of the data. This
  is needed when the user wants to analyze the two sides separately.
5. Removed ngood attribute from CorrData, corresponding changes have been implemented for other
  functions in "noise".
6. Added subset() method in CorrData() to subset data by time range.
7. Added filter() method in CorrData() to filter corrdata.data.
8. Added DvvData class to store dvv monitoring data.

MONITORING
1. Added get_dvv() as a wrapper to measure dvv with given CorrData object.
2. Added extract_dvvdata() to extract DvvData object from a ASDF file.

OBSMASTER
1. Removed getdata() and deprecated getobsdata(). Data downloading is now handled all by downloaders.

==================================================================================
==================================================================================
Updates in v0.6.2

PLOTTING
1. Added plot_stations() to plot seismic station map using GMT

2. Fixed minor bugs in plot_waveform()

3. Updated plot_corrfile() to take more options, more consistent with CorrData.plot()


DOWNLOADERS
1. Fixed bug in get_event_waveforms() where only one station was downloaded. now it downloads
all station data.

2. Return Stream() for waveform data.

UTILS
1. Added subsetindex()
2. Added points_in_polygon() and generate_points_in_polygon()
3. Added read_gmtlines() to read in line segments in GMT style.
4. Added read_ncmodel3d to read 3-D model files in netCDF format.
5. Added read_ncmodel2d to read 2-D model files in netCDF format.
6. Added ncmodel_in_polygon to extract seismic model within polygons.

TYPES
1. Pushed cc_len and cc_step in CorrData.
2. Added in CorrData.stack() the option to stack over segmented time windows.

SETUP
1. Added requirement for shapely and netCDF4 packages.
